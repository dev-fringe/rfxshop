This project is Duplicated from 
Shopizer(https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer)

The goal of this project is to extend for general purpose business Commerce site.
I will enrich this project and merge Several other Open Source Projects according to requests of my client.

I'm planning to attach several other packages to Shopier, 
and add more elegant responsive home page theme.

if possible, i don't want to change original source.
i will only use APIs.
but If necessary, perhaps i shall crone code.

below is Projects to be atttached:

CMS for Catalog Manager for Shop Owner : Hippo(http://www.onehippo.org)  
Blogging about Product : Apache Roller (http://http://roller.apache.org)
Single Sign One for All System : JOSSO (http://www.josso.org)
